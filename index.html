            <h3 id="help-content-game">Game overview</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Scalade</strong> is a trick-taking card game, primarily for three players, played with a
                traditional 52-card pack
                of cards (usually with some cards removed).
            </p>
            <p>
                Each player plays for themselves. There is a 'ladder' in each suit, represented by a card of that suit
                on the table.
                Players win control of ladders by winning tricks that contain the card above the current rank (the
                'rung') in that suit,
                with this new, higher, rank becoming the rung for that ladder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Players score points by having control of ladders at the end of a deal, with additional bonuses for
                holding onto ladders in suits that they had control of at the end of the previous hand.
                These 'holding bonuses' can grow from deal to deal, leading to potentially very high-scoring bonuses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Full rules for the game are available <a href="https://repiqued-interests.co.uk/games/scalade"
                    target="_blank">at this Scalade web-page</a>
            </p>
            <h3 id="help-content-app">About the app</h3>
            <p>
                This app currently only the three-player version.
                It can be played with 'Mobile Scalade' rules (default), 'Static Scalade', or 'Retromobile Scalade'.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game runs entirely in-browser. If you navigate away from the page, or refresh, the current game will
                be lost.
                There are no current facilities for saving/loading a game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bot players run using trained neural networks at their core.
                They have access only to the same information a real player would, or less (depending on the bot).
                All current bots have been trained on Static Scalade, and so will tend to perform less well on Mobile,
                and even less well on Retromobile.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three bot players currently, <strong>Arundel</strong>,
                <strong>Bodiam</strong> and <strong>Camber</strong>.
                Both computer positions are currently hard set to use 'Camber'.
                They both always pick the move they think is best. They both have access to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>their hand of cards,</li>
                <li>the suit led (if any),</li>
                <li>the trump suit,</li>
                <li>which trick of the hand it is.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Arundel has access to no further information, so cannot for instance remember which cards have been
                played
                already.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, Bodiam and Camber have access to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the cards played to the current trick (if any),</li>
                <li>cards of the pack which have not yet been seen,</li>
                <li>current ladder cards and their holders,</li>
                <li>the holding bonus factors of each player,</li>
                <li>suits which each opponent has renounced in (if any),</li>
                <li>whether or not he is playing last to the trick.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Other bot players may become available in due course, along with the ability to choose.
            </p>
