            <h3>Game overview</h3>
            <p>
                Scalade is a trick-taking card game, primarily for three players, played with a traditional 52-card pack
                of cards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each player plays for themselves. There is a 'ladder' in each suit, represented by a card of that suit
                on the table.
                Players win control of ladders by winning tricks that contain the card above the current rank (the
                'rung') in that suit,
                with this new, higher, rank becoming the rung for that ladder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Players score points by having control of ladders at the end of a deal, with additional bonuses for
                holding onto ladders in suits that they had control of at the end of the previous hand.
                These 'holding bonuses' can grow from deal to deal, leading to potentially very high-scoring bonuses.
            </p>
